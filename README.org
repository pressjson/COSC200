#+title: COSC 200
#+author: Jason Press

This is Jason Press and Mia Stulac's project for COSC 200. Although I don't know if Mia Stulac is caring about this anymore, so I guess it's just Jason Press (?)

This project is training a neural network to upscale scanned scores.

* Setup the data

For literally anything in this project to run, you /need/ the following packages:

- [[https://www.python.org/][Python 3.11+]]
- [[https://pytorch.org/][PyTorch]]
- ~bash~
- ~curl~
- ~magick~

Set up the venv with ~source venv/bin/activate~ or however you activate with your specific shell.

* What is left to do?

1. Make my code not a jumbled spaghetti mess of garbage that works on a prayer
2. Have ~test.py~ put the images back in their pdf order, and combine them back into a pdf
3. Have ~test.py~ crop the images back to their original size after they get chunked
4. Hope it's better than traditional general-purpose upscaling techniques in some manner
5. Write a paper
6. Profit
